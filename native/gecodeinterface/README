This project creates a standalone executeable 'solver' that interfaces with
gecode and provides a simple REPL interface.

To build, ensure you have the gecode dev libs installed, then run

./quickbuild

(Makefile coming in subsequent update)

To run examples against standlone solver, they must firtst be converted
into the correct format for the solver executable to understand.

The file test/reader.rb will parse the content of examples in
../../test/data and output it in a form usable by standalone solver.

For example:
./quickbuild
test/reader.rb ../../test/data/log-07be9e47-6f42-4a5d-b8b5-1d2eae1ad83b.txt | ../../priv/solver
